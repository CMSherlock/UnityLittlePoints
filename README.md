    <tr>
        <th>NaughtySnake</th>
        <td>It's a small Gluttonous Snake game. <br/>
            What did this snake do ? :: go through the wall and transmit to the other side,and this snake also can eat && die.<br/>
            <b>BUG here</b>::   if you let the Snake rotate around the corner continuously,part of the body will just run away.Though i have a way to fix it ... but it still looks wired.
            <b>TO READ HERE</b> :: I have a debug function in the "_Head" script, before you playing it , commented it first.
